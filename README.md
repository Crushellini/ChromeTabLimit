This extension allows you to set a tab limit on your chrome window so that any attempts at creating additional tabs after the limit has been reached will fail. 

This is meant for people (like me) who have trouble managing their tabs and end up with a very messy chrome window with 50+ tabs.

The extension will set the tab limit to 10 by default. This default limit can be changed by entering a new value and clicking "Save".

Clicking "Set" will set the tab limit of the current Chrome window to the entered value, and will not affect the default value.
